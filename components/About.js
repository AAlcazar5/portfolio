          I am a 26 year old software developer and data scientist from Modesto,
          California. My goal is to solve problems with software while having
          fun. I enjoy web development as a discipline because it provides the
          opportunity to create something new from the imagination. I enjoy
          data science as a discipline because it provides the opportunity to
          use the analytical side of the brain and come up with unique solutions
          to problems based on patterns that lurk just beneath the surface. The
          ideal role would be one that challenges me creatively and
          analytically.
